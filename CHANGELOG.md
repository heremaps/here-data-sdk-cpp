## v0.7.0-beta (09/09/2019)

**Common**

* Introduced new abstract `olp::thread::TaskScheduler` to be used for async context; provided default thread pool implementation.
* Added `UserAgent` HTTP header to mark all triggered requests.
* Added China Lookup API URLs.
* Introduced new HTTP abstraction layer `olp::http::Network` without singleton usage. Platform dependent implementations adapted and aligned with coding style.
* `olp::network::Network` with according implementations and helper classes removed.
* Changed `olp::client::CancellationContext` to shared pimpl so we can remove the `std::shared_ptr` wrapper when using it across multiple requests.
* Improved logging in core components.

**olp-edge-sdk-cpp-authentication**

* **Breaking Change** - Use new HTTP layer as input parameter for all requests. This is a mandatory parameter and users must provide it.
* **Breaking Change** - Use new `olp::thread::TaskScheduler`; provided as input parameter.
* Removed usage of raw `std::thread` and switched to `olp::thread::TaskScheduler`. If the `olp::thread::TaskScheduler` instance is not provided, all tasks are executed in the calling thread.

* **Breaking Change** - Use new HTTP layer as input parameter for all requests. This is a mandatory parameter and users must provide it.
* **Breaking Change** - Use new `olp::thread::TaskScheduler`; provided as input parameter.
* Removed usage of raw `std::thread` and switched to `olp::thread::TaskScheduler`. If the `olp::thread::TaskScheduler` instance is not provided, all tasks are executed in the calling thread.
* Improved logging.

**olp-edge-sdk-cpp-dataservice-write**

* **Breaking Change** - Use new HTTP layer as input parameter for all requests. This is a mandatory parameter and users must provide it.
* **Breaking Change** - `olp::dataservice::write::StreamLayerClient` uses new `olp::thread::TaskScheduler` as input parameter for async context. If the `olp::thread::TaskScheduler` instance is not provided, all tasks are executed in the calling thread.

## v0.6.0-beta (27/06/2019)
Initial open source release as a _work in progress_ beta.
<br />Not all OLP features are implemented, API breaks very likely with following commits and releases.

**olp-edge-sdk-cpp-authentication**

* Sign up new user with e-mail and password.
* Sign up new user with Facebook, Google, ArcGIS credentials.
* Accept terms and log out user.
* AAA OAuth2 with registered user credentials.

**olp-edge-sdk-cpp-dataservice-read**

* Read from Catalog (configuration, layers).
* Read from Versioned Layer (partitions metadata, partition data).
* Read from Volatile Layer (partitions metadata, partition data).
* Cache results on disk for later use.

**olp-edge-sdk-cpp-dataservice-write**

* Write to Versioned Layer (initialize publication, upload data and metadata, submit publication).
* Write to Volatile Layer (initialize publication, upload metadata, submit publication, upload data).
* Write to Stream Layer (publish data, queue data for asyncronous publish, publish SDII messages, batch write).
* Write to Index Layer (publish index, delete index, update index).
