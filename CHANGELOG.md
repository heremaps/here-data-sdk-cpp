## v1.7.0 (06/16/2020)

**Common**

* Changed the product name from HERE OLP SDK for C++ to HERE Data SDK for C++.
* Fixed formatting to be compliant with the coding style.
* Fixed the issue with `olp::client::TaskContext`. Now, it does not trigger cancellation after a successful operation.
* Added the `default_cache_expiration` to `olp::client::OlpClientSettings`. Now, you can control how long the downloaded data is considered valid. Once the data is expired, you cannot retrieve it, and it is gradually removed from the cache when new data is added.
* Added the `OLP_SDK_DISABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` CMake option. When enabled, the SDK does not print any `TRACE` or `DEBUG` level log messages.
* Added the `compression` setting to `olp::cache::CacheSettings`. You can now pass the flag to the underlying database engine to enable or disable the data compression.
* Added the `Compact` API to `olp::cache::DefaultCache`. It is used to optimize the underlying mutable cache storage. Compaction also starts automatically once the database size reaches the maximum in a separate thread.
* Changed the `olp::cache::DefaultCache` read operation. As a result, the number of memory allocation decreased, and performance increased.
* Added support for the HTTP `OPTIONS` request in `olp::http::Network`.
* The LRU eviction now evicts expired elements first. The eviction time decreased.
* Removed the retry code from `olp::http::NetworkCurl`. Now, retries are performed by `olp::client::OlpClient`.
* Added a prewarm helper method to `olp::client::OlpClientSettingsFactory`. This method can be used to perform DNS prefetch and TLS preconnect for certain URLs that are widely used by the clients. For example, accounts and lookup.
* Enabled certificate validation in `olp::http::NetworkCurl`.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* The `olp::authentication::TokenProvider` class now handles the concurrent by blocking all requesters until the already triggered request completes. It verifies that only one token is requested at the same time.
* The `IntrospectApp` and `Authorize` APIs now use `ExponentialBackdownStrategy` internally in case of a 5xx HTTP status code.
* `olp::authentication::AuthenticationError` class is deprecated and will be replaced by `olp::client::ApiError`. It will be removed by 12.2020.
* Switched the `SignInClient` method in the `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient` functionality to `TaskContext`.
* Added a fallback mechanism for `SignInClient`. Now, when the system time is wrong, the server time is used.
* Changed the `olp::authentication::ActionResult` class. Permissions are now represented by the `olp::authentication::Permission` class.
* The `use_system_time` flag in `olp::authentication::Settings` is now enabled by default. Now, system time is used for token requests by default.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* The module now resolves all service APIs for a specific HRN in a single request.
* Reduced the number of logs produced by the component.
* Merged the same concurrent Lookup API requests into a single HTTP request.
* Merged the same concurrent `GetBlob` and `GetVolatileBlob` API requests into a single HTTP request.
* Merged the same concurrent `QuadTreeIndex` API requests into a single HTTP request.
* **Work In Progress** Added a new `ListVersions` API to `olp::dataservice::read::CatalogClient`. You can use it to get information on catalog versions.
* **Work In Progress** Added a new `GetAggregatedData` API to `olp::dataservice::read::VersionedLayerClient`. You can use it to retrieve tile data (if it exists) or the nearest parent tile data. Use this API for tile-tree structures where children tile data is aggregated and stored in parent tiles.

## v1.6.0 (05/01/2020)

**Common**

* Added the LRU functionality to the mutable disk cache. LRU is enabled by default. You can disable it using `eviction_policy` in `CacheSettings`.
* Completed the network statistics implementation. It's available in `Network::GetStatistics`. Now, you can get accumulated statistics on how many bytes are processed during each operation.
* Added the missing `CORE_API` export macros.
* Updated various classes according to the Google coding style.
* Added information on backward compatibility.
* Fixed various compiler warnings.
* Minor documentation changes.
* Fixed the Android bug that made network responses incomplete.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* Added the `use_system_time` flag to `olp::authentication::Settings`. You can use it when retrieving tokens to tell `olp::authentication::TokenProvider` to work with the system time instead of the server time.
* Added the `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient::Authorize` method. You can use it to collect all permissions associated with the authenticated user or application.
* `olp::authentication::TokenProvider` now uses the pimpl idiom. Now, when you copy an instance of this class, it does not create a new request.
* Deprecated the `olp::authentication:AutoRefreshingToken` class. It will be removed by 10.2020.
* **Breaking Change** Removed the deprecated constructor of the `AuthenticationClient` class and the following deprecated methods: `SetNetworkProxySettings`, `SetNetwork`, and `SetTaskScheduler`.
* The deprecation of the `olp::authentication::TokenEndpoint` and `olp::authentication::TokenRequest` classes is extended until 10.2020.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* Optimized memory overhead for prefetch. 
* Removed the ambiguous `PrefetchTilesRequest::WithTileKeys` method that takes an rvalue reference.

## v1.5.0 (07/04/2020)

**Common**

* Moved the `DefaultCache` implementation to pimpl.
* Fixed various compiler warnings.
* CMake now uses the official Boost Github repository instead of downloading and unpacking the archive.
* Method `OlpClientSettingsFactory::CreateDefaultCache` now returns `nullptr` if it failes to open one of the user-defined disk caches.
* **Work In Progress** Added API to retrieve network statistics. It is not fully implemented yet, and users should not use it.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* Added a new `use_system_time` flag to `olp::authentication::AuthenticationSettings`. You can use it to tell the authentication module to work with system time instead of server time when retrieving tokens.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* Added a stream layer read example. For more information, see our [documentation](https://github.com/heremaps/here-olp-sdk-cpp/blob/master/docs/dataservice-read-from-stream-layer-example.md).
* Added the `RemoveFromCache` method to `VolatileLayerClient`. Now, you can remove specific partitions or tiles from the mutable cache.
* Added a new `PrefetchTiles` method to `VolatileLayerClient`. Now, you can prefetch volatile tiles in the same way as versioned tiles.

## v1.4.0 (23/03/2020)

**Common**

* **Breaking Change** Removed the deprecated `disk_path` property. Use the `disk_path_mutable` property instead.
* The `DefaultCache` constructor is now explicit and takes `CacheSettings` by value.
* Fixed data that was not validated during reading from LevelDB when the `olp::cache::OpenOptions::CheckCrc` property was provided.
* Various improvements in `olp::http::NetworkCurl` implementation. Some legacy features were removed.
* Added the `SetDefaultHeaders` method to `olp::http::Network`. Now, you can set default HTTP headers for each request made by `Network`. User agents set with default headers and user agents passed with network requests are concatenated into one header.
* Reduced compiler warnings about deprecated methods and classes.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* Removed the deprecated `AuthenticationClient::SignInClient` method.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* Added the `RemoveFromCache` method to `VersionedLayerClient`. Now, you can remove specific partitions or tiles from the mutable cache.
* `VersionedLayerClient` now triggers an error when the request is passed with `FetchOption::CacheWithUpdate`. It makes no sense to update data when it is available in a cache for `VersionedLayerClient` since the version is locked.
* Now, when you pass a request to `VersionedLayerClient` or `VolatileLayerClient` with `FetchOption::OnlineOnly`, data is not stored in a cache. It is designed for a use case when you are not interested in storing data in a cache.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-write**

* Deprecated the  `olp::dataservice::write::StreamLayerClient::CreateDefaultCache` method. It will be removed by 06.2020.

## v1.3.0 (04/03/2020)

**Common**

* Response headers are now stored in `olp::client::HttpResponse`. `olp::client::OlpClient::CallApi()` collects and adds headers to the response.
* X-Correlation-ID is now extracted from the HTTP response headers and used for subsequent requests in `olp::dataservice::read::StreamLayerClient`.
* Added a new backdown strategy to `olp::client::RetrySettings`.
  The default implementation is `olp::client::ExponentialBackdownStrategy` that restricts the maximum wait time during failed retries of network requests in the `olp::network::client::OlpClient` class (both synchronous and asynchronous versions). The accumulated wait time during retries should not be longer than the `RetrySettings.timeout` property.
* Added `curl_global_init()` and `curl_global_cleanup()` to the `olp::http::NetworkCurl` class (Linux default implementation).
  For more information, see the `olp::client::OlpClientSettingsFactory::CreateDefaultNetworkRequestHandler()` function.
* Fixed MSVC, Clang, and GCC warnings. Now, when you build with `-Wall -Wextra`, you should not face any hidden warnings, as the codebase is protected by a pre-release verification job.
* Fixed the possible thread concurrency problem in the `olp::client::OlpClient` class that resulted in a crash in some situations.
* Reduced data copy in the JSON serializers to increase performance.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* Added a new API to `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient` that you can use to perform a generic federated authentication with a custom request body.
* Added the `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient::IntrospectApp()` method that you can use to retrieve information
  about the application associated with a particular access token.
* Added a new `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient` constructor using `olp::authentication::AuthenticationSettings` to setup network and task scheduler. It is a part of an ongoing authentication refactoring. Switch to this constructor instead of using the individual setters.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* `olp::dataservice::read::PartitionsRequest` now supports a list of partition IDs. This way, when you use `olp::dataservice::read::VersionedLayerClient` and `olp::dataservice::read::VolatileLayerClient`, you can also request certain partitions instead of the entire layer metadata.
* Added the `Seek` method to `olp::dataservice::read::StreamLayerClient`. This method can be used to start reading messages from a stream layer at any given position.
* Added the `Poll` method to `olp::dataservice::read::StreamLayerClient`. This method reads messages from a stream layer and commits successfully consumed messages before handing them over to you.
* Added the `olp::dataservice::read::TileRequest` class and corresponding `GetData` overload to `olp::dataservice::read::VersionedLayerClient`. Now, you can get data using a tile key. Internally, the metadata retrieval is optimized by using a quadtree request and saves bandwidth on subsequent `GetData` calls.
* Added additional fields to the `olp::dataservice::read::PartitionsRequest` class. Now, you can access the following additional metadata
  fields: data size, compressed data size, checksum, and CRC.
* Deprecated the `WithVersion` and the `GetVersion` methods in the `olp::dataservice::read::DataRequest`, `olp::dataservice::read::PartitionsRequest` and `olp::dataservice::read::PrefetchTilesRequest` classes. `olp::dataservice::read::VersionedLayerClient` now locks the catalog version either to the value provided on the constructor or by requesting the latest catalog version from the backend. This ensures that consistent data is provided for the instance lifecycle.
* Fixed cache keys by appending 'partition' and 'partitions' to key values in `olp::dataservice::read::VolatileLayerClient`.
* Fixed the infinite loop in the `olp::dataservice::read::VersionedLayerClient::PrefetchTiles()` method when min/max levels are not specified.

## v1.2.0 (04/02/2020)

**Common**

* Added a protected read-only cache. For details, see `olp::cache::CacheSettings`.
* Added a protected read-only cache [usage example](https://github.com/heremaps/here-olp-sdk-cpp/blob/c30c4051ec012eaca09b7aa7ba4c7e8f6cd7a576/docs/dataservice-cache-example.md).

* Added the `ErrorCodeToString` function to olp/core/http/NetworkTypes.h.
* Improved the `olp::http::NetworkCurl` logging.
* Changed the `IsNull` function in the `olp::client::HRN` class to handle realms according to platform changes.
* Added the bool operator to the `olp::client::HRN` class. You can now use the operator to check whether all the service type fields in the `olp::client::HRN` class are not empty.
* Fixed a possible data race in the `olp::client::Condition` class.
* Added the `MoveResult` method to the `olp::client::ApiResponse` class. The method returns an rvalue reference to the result.
* CMake now requires RapidJSON v1.1.0.
* Various CMake cleanups.
* Improved error handling in Android `HttpClient`.
* Fixed the linking error when SDK was statically linked inside a shared library with `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`.
* The retry policy now handles server errors automatically.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* Added a possibility to parse credentials from a file or stream in `olp::authentication::AuthenticationCredentials`. Now, to get credentials for the `AuthenticationCredentials` class, you can use the **credentials.properties** file that is provided by the platform.
* Deprecated the `olp::authentication::TokenEndpoint` class. It will be removed by 04.2020.
* Deprecated the `olp::authentication::TokenRequest` class. It will be removed by 04.2020.
* Deprecated various methods in `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient`.
* Authentication now gets the current timestamp from the platform and uses it to request the OAuth2 token that prevents replay attacks. As a fallback, the system time is used.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* The `olp::dataservice::read::QueryApi`, `olp::dataservice::read::MetadataApi`, `olp::dataservice::read::LookupApi`, and `olp::dataservice::read::BlobApi` classes are now blocking and use the new synchronous `CallApi` method in `OlpClient`.
* The `GetData` method of the versioned and volatile layer now triggers the `olp::client::ErrorCode::PreconditionFailed` error if both a partition ID and data handle are passed in the data request.
* **Work-in-progress**: Added reading support for streamed data using the new `olp::dataservice::read::StreamLayerClient`. Currently, you can only subscribe, unsubscribe, and get data from a stream layer message.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-write**

* Enhanced `olp::dataservice::write::StreamLayerClient` to use `olp::thread::TaskScheduler` for asynchronous operations instead of network threads.
* Removed the unused `olp::dataservice::write::ThreadSafeQueue` class.
* Deprecated the `CancelAll` methods in all layers. Use the `CancelPendingRequests` methods instead.

## v1.1.0 (11/12/2019)

**Common**

* The deprecated `olp::client::CancellationToken::cancel()` method was removed. Use `olp::client::CancellationToken::Cancel()` instead.
* The `curl` network implementation was fixed and can now compile on 32 bits architecture.
* The `disk_path` field in `olp::cache::CacheSettings` is deprecated. Use the `disk_path_mutable` field instead.
* A new synchronous `CallApi` method was added to `olp::client::OlpClient`.
* `pipe` and `pipe2` symbols detection are enhanced in curl.cmake.

**olp-cpp-sdk-authentication**

* The `SignInClient` method in `olp::authentication::AuthenticationClient` is deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `SignInClient` method with a different signature.
* The `scope` support was added to OAuth2 through `olp::authentication::SignInProperties`. You can now access the project bound resources using the `olp::authentication::SignInProperties::scope` field.
* The `error_id` field was added to the `ErrorResponse` structure. You can use it to get the `errorId` string from the authentication error response.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* The deprecated `GetCatalogMetadataVersion` method was removed from the `olp::dataservice::read::CatalogClient`.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-write**

* Legacy and unused code were removed.

## v1.0.0 (03/12/2019)

**Common**

* A new CMake flag `OLP_SDK_BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION_EXTERNAL` was introduced to compile the SDK without exceptions. The user needs to provide the custom `boost::throw_exception` function.
* `olp::client::HttpResponse` now holds `std::stringstream` instead of `std::string`. This removes expensive copies.
* The CMake minimum version increased to 3.9.
* The `cancel` method in `CancellationToken` is deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `Cancel` method.
* Network logs improved for all platforms.
* Various bug fixes and improvements.
* The Network limit is now implemented for all platforms. When the limit is reached, the `Network::Send` method returns `olp::http::ErrorCode::NETWORK_OVERLOAD_ERROR`, and client users receive `olp::client::ErrorCode::SlowDown` as a response.
* Android network client can now be used when Java VM is embedded in a native application.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-read**

* The `VersionedLayerClient` and `VolatileLayerClient` classes are now movable and non-copyable.
* The `TaskContext` and `PendingRequests` classes moved to the core component, and are now public.
* The `GetCatalogMetadataVersion` method in `CatalogClient` is deprecated. The `GetLatestVersion` method should be used instead.
* All deprecated methods marked in v0.8.0 are now removed.
* A new optional parameter for a catalog version was added to `PrefetchTileRequest`. It is used by `VersionedLayerClient::PrefetchTiles()`. If not provided, the latest catalog version is queried from OLP instead.

**olp-cpp-sdk-dataservice-write**

* Missing `DATASERVICE_WRITE_API` was added to various classes.
