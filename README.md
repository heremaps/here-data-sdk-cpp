## Why Use

The HERE OLP Edge SDK C++ provides support for core HERE Open Location Platform (OLP) use cases through a set of native C++ interfaces. The SDK is intended to save your time and effort on using OLP REST APIs and provides a set of stable APIs that simplify complex OLP operations and remove the burden of keeping up to date with the latest OLP REST API changes.

It's a modern (C++11 or later), lightweight, and modular SDK with minimal dependencies that is targeted towards a wide range of hardware platforms, from embedded devices to desktops.

This SDK lets you:

* Authenticate to HERE Open Location Platform (OLP) using client credentials.
* Read catalog and partitions metadata.
* Retrieve data from versioned and volatile layers of OLP catalogs.
* Upload your own data to OLP.

Additionally, the SDK includes convenient classes for work with the geospatial tiling schemes that are used by most OLP catalog layers.

## Supported Platforms

The SDK has been tested on the following platforms and with the following requirements:

| Platform | Minimum requirement |
| ------- | -------- |
| Ubuntu | GCC 5.4 and Clang 7.0 |
| Windows | MSVC++ 2017  |
| MacOS | Apple Clang 10.0.1 |
| iOS |  XCode 10.2, Swift 5.0 |
| Android |  API level 21 |

## Dependencies

The dependencies of the HERE OLP Edge SDK C++ are the following:

| Library   | Minimum version |
| --------- | --------------- |
| OpenSSL   | 1.0.2 |
| Boost (headers only) | 1.69.0 |
| leveldb   | 1.21 |
| snappy    | 1.1.7 |
| rapidjson | latest |

## Building the SDK

[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) is the main build system. The minimal required version of CMake is 3.5.

CMake downloads [leveldb](https://github.com/google/leveldb), [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy), [rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson), and [Boost](https://www.boost.org/). This can be disabled by setting `EDGE_SDK_BUILD_EXTERNAL_DEPS` to `OFF`. For details on CMake flags, see [below](#cmake-flags).

Optionally, if you want to build documentation from annotated source code, you need to install [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).

### Building on Linux [![Linux build status][1]][2] [![Linux code coverage][5]][6]

#### Additional Linux Dependencies

Additionally to the dependencies listed above, building the SDK on Linux requires [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) 7.47.0 or later.

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --yes install git g++ make cmake libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-all-dev
```

#### Build

To build the HERE OLP Edge SDK C++, run the following commands in the root of the repository folder after cloning:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To build the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation, you need to have CMake version 3.9 or later, and set `EDGE_SDK_BUILD_DOC=ON` when running CMake configuration:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DEDGE_SDK_BUILD_DOC=ON ..
make docs
```

#### Install

By default this SDK downloads and compiles its dependencies. The versions of downloaded dependencies may conflict with versions already installed on your system, so they are not added to the install targets.

Therefore, to install the HERE OLP Edge SDK C++, you must first install all its dependencies. Then you need to configure the SDK with `EDGE_SDK_BUILD_EXTERNAL_DEPS` set to `OFF` so that it finds required dependencies in the system.

Another option is to build the SDK as a shared library, setting the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` flag to `ON`.

The following command builds and installs the HERE OLP Edge SDK C++:

```bash
cmake --build . --target install
```

Alternatively, if you want to use the SDK directly in your CMake project, you can add it via `add_subdirectory()`.

### Building on Windows [![Windows build status][3]][4]

We assume that you have installed CMake and Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.

Launch Visual Studio as administrator and open the folder containing the SDK or a CMake-based project using the SDK. Make sure that the target in Visual Studio does not contain "* (Default)". For example, select "x64-Debug" instead of "x64-Debug (Default)".
Using the provided CMake menu by the Visual C++ tools for CMake, generate the `.cmake` files and build the entire project normally.

> **Note:**
> Visual Studio uses a default build directory that has a long path name. It's recommended that you edit the generated `CMakeSettings.json` and change the build directory to a short path name, since dependencies for the SDK are installed within the build directory. This ensures that the maximum length for each individual path is not greater than 260 characters. For details, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/naming-a-file).

### CMake Flags

#### `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`

Defaults to `OFF`. If enabled, this causes all libraries to be built as shared.

#### `EDGE_SDK_BUILD_DOC`

Defaults to `OFF`. If enabled, the API reference is to be generated in your build directory.

> **Note:**
> This requires [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) to be installed.

#### `EDGE_SDK_ENABLE_TESTING`

Defaults to `ON`. If enabled, unit tests are to be built for each library.

#### `EDGE_SDK_BUILD_EXTERNAL_DEPS`

Defaults to `ON`. If enabled, CMake downloads and compiles dependencies.

#### `EDGE_SDK_NO_EXCEPTION`

Defaults to `OFF`. If enabled, this causes all libraries to be built without exceptions.

#### `EDGE_SDK_MSVC_PARALLEL_BUILD_ENABLE` (Windows Only)

Defaults to `ON`. If enabled, this adds `/MP` compilation flag to build SDK using multiple cores.
