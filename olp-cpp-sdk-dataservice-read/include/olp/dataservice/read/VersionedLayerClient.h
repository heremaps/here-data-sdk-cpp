 * @brief Gets data from a versioned layer of the HERE platform.
 *
 * The versioned layer stores slowly-changing data that must remain logically
 * consistent with other layers in a catalog. You can request any data version
 * from the versioned
 * layer.
 * When you request a particular version of data from the versioned layer,
 * the partition you receive in the response may have a lower version number
 * than you requested. The version of a layer or partition represents the
 * catalog version in which the layer or partition was last updated.
 *
 * @note If the catalog version is not specified, the latest version is used.
 *
 * An example with the catalog version provided that saves one network request:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * auto task_scheduler =
 *    olp::client::OlpClientSettingsFactory::CreateDefaultTaskScheduler(1u);
 * auto http_client = olp::client::
 *    OlpClientSettingsFactory::CreateDefaultNetworkRequestHandler();
 *
 * olp::authentication::Settings settings{"Your.Key.Id", "Your.Key.Secret"};
 * settings.task_scheduler = task_scheduler;
 * settings.network_request_handler = http_client;
 *
 * olp::client::AuthenticationSettings auth_settings;
 * auth_settings.provider =
 *     olp::authentication::TokenProviderDefault(std::move(settings));
 *
 * auto client_settings = olp::client::OlpClientSettings();
